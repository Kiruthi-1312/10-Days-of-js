# Task

The code in the editor has a tagged template literal that passes the area and perimeter of a rectangle to a tag function named sides.
Recall that the first argument of a tag function is an array of string literals from the template,
and the subsequent values are the template's respective expression values.

**Complete the function in the editor so that it does the following:** 

**1.** Finds the initial values of s1 and s2 by plugging the area and perimeter values into the formula : s = p +- sqrt(p^2 - 16*A)/4

where A is the rectangle's area and p is its perimeter.

**2.** Creates an array consisting of  and  and sorts it in ascending order.

**3.** Returns the sorted array.
